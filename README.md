# TayMark Book Meetings Application
This is a WPF application used for managing Ad Hoc meetings within the TayMark business (fictional company). You are able to book a meeting and see meetings you have lined up for the day. This application is an effective representation of my skills with the MVVM design model, LINQ, and the WPF framework.
